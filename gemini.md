# YewseoYewooWeeklyReport

## Project Purpose
This project is a weekly report management tool for two teenage daughters:
- **Yeseo** (예서) - 16 years old
- **Yewoo** (여우) - 15 years old

The app helps them manage and track their weekly:
- **Study** - school work, assignments, study sessions
- **Workout** - exercise routines, physical activities
- **Rest** - sleep, breaks, relaxation time

## Key Principles
- Keep the UI simple and age-appropriate for teenagers
- Weekly basis tracking and reporting
- Support both daughters independently with their own data
